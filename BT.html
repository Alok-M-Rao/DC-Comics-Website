        <p> The Dark Knight Trilogy is a superhero film trilogy, based on the DC Comics character Batman. The trilogy consisted of Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), directed by Christopher Nolan.
            <br><br>

            Following the critical failure and box-office disappointment of Batman & Robin (1997), Warner Bros. rebooted the film franchise. The trilogy stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.
            <br><br> 
         
            Each film in the series was a box-office success, in particular the second and third films, which both earned over $1 billion worldwide. In addition, the films have received near-universal acclaim from critics and audiences, being praised for Nolan's direction and writing, the performances of the cast, the more realistic and darker reinvention of the source material, its major use of practical effects and stunts over computer generated imagery, and Hans Zimmer's score for each film.
            <br><br>
            
            Because the trilogy was meant to be a stand-alone series, the character is set to be rebooted once again for the upcoming DC Extended Universe, starting with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in 2016.

        <a name="1"><h2>Batman Begins</h2>

         <p> As a child, Bruce Wayne falls down a dry well, where he is attacked by a swarm of bats; he subsequently develops chiroptophobia. While watching an opera with his parents, Bruce is frightened by performers masquerading as bats, and asks to leave. Outside, the family is targeted by a mugger, Joe Chill, who murders Bruce's parents, leaving him to be raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.
             <br><br>

             Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill in revenge, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the legal system, telling Bruce that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone in a nightclub, where Falcone demonstrates that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world, learning new skills and abilities to confront injustice. In Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard who offers to train him as a member of the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt and beyond saving, having done so with other cities for centuries. Bruce rejects their crusade, which causes a battle and fire that burns down the League's temple. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves an unconscious Ducard.
             <br><br> 

            Posing as a billionaire playboy, Bruce returns to Gotham intent on fighting crime. He develops a base in the bat-infested caves beneath Wayne manor, and takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, run by the unscrupulous William Earle. The company's top scientist, Lucius Fox, introduces Bruce to various prototype technologies including the Tumbler (a heavily armored car) and a protective bodysuit, which Bruce uses to take up the vigilante identity of "Batman". As Batman, he intercepts a drug shipment and provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, empowering the honest Sgt. James Gordon to arrest the previously untouchable criminal.
            <br><br>
             
            Falcone is declared mentally unfit for trial by the corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane, and transferred to Arkham Asylum. When Falcone threatens to reveal that he has been importing a fear-inducing hallucinogenic drug for Crane's employers, Crane exposes him to the drug while wearing a burlap mask, driving Falcone insane with fear of the "Scarecrow". While investigating Crane, Batman is exposed to the drug and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. At Arkham, Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, and Crane reveals he has been pouring the drug into Gotham's water supply. He doses Rachel with it, but she is rescued by Batman, who leads a destructive chase through Gotham in the Tumbler to escape the police. Batman cures Rachel and leaves her with two vials of the antidote; one for Gordon, and one for mass production. After Crane is arrested, Gordon learns that the tainted water supply is only harmful if inhaled.
            <br><br>

            During his 30th birthday celebration at the manor, Bruce is confronted by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul; Bruce expels his guests so they will be safe. Ra's reveals that he employed Crane, and stole a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, that will be used to vaporize the tainted water supply, making the drug airborne and causing mass hysteria and violence that will destroy Gotham. Ra's' men set fire to the mansion, and Bruce is saved by Alfred, who secures them in the Batcave before the fire engulfs the building. As the League's plot commences, Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her before pursuing Ra's onto a monorail train carrying the emitter toward Gotham's central water source. Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track and derail the train. Batman overpowers Ra's but refuses to kill him, while also refusing to save him, before gliding from the train car, leaving Ra's to die as the train crashes and explodes.
            <br><br>
           Batman becomes a public hero, but loses Rachel, who cannot be with Bruce while he is Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Gordon — now promoted to Lieutenant of the Gotham Police Force — shows Batman the Bat-Signal and mentions a criminal who leaves Joker playing cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate and disappears into the night.

        <a name="2"><h2>The Dark Knight</h2>    
           
          <p> Nine months after the events of the first film, organized crime has become the most irritating problem in Gotham City, so Batman (Christian Bale) and Police Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) decide to include newly-elected district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in their plan to eradicate the mob organizing it. Although Dent is dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Batman's alter ego, billionaire socialite Bruce Wayne, offers to support the DA by throwing him a fundraiser. Meanwhile, mob leaders Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts), Gambol (Michael Jai White) and the Chechen (Ritchie Coster) hold a videoconference with Chinese accountant Lau (Chin Han), who has hidden their funds from Batman, Gordon and Dent and fled to Hong Kong. A murderous psychopath called the Joker (Heath Ledger), who has recently stolen a deposit of the funds from one of the local banks, interrupts the meeting and warns that Batman is unhindered by juristiction. He offers to kill Batman for half of the money, but the mob bosses refuse, and Gambol puts a bounty on him. As a result, the Joker kills Gambol and takes control of his men. His predictions are proven correct, however, when Batman brings Lau back to Gotham to testify against the mob.
              <br><br>

              Gordon arrests Maroni and the Chechen, but both mob bosses, along with a few others, eventually make bail in court as Dent prosecutes the rest and 549 of their men. As a result, the mob agrees to hire the Joker, who films his murder of a Batman impersonator on TV and announces that people will die each day until Batman reveals his identity, first killing Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Colin McFarlane) and one of the judges presiding over the mob trials. He also targets Dent at the fundraiser, but Bruce hides Dent and leaves to suit up as Batman while Rachel stalls the Joker. During the resulting fight, the Joker drops Rachel out of the fundraiser penthouse window, but Batman saves her and and ensures her that Dent is alright.
              <br><br>

              The next day, Bruce struggles to understand the Joker's motive as his butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) explains that he dealt with problems like these before against against a bandit who stole a collection of jewels being bribed to the Burmese government as good sport for the purpose of just causing chaos, because some men just want to watch the world burn. Later, as Batman and Gordon are investigating the Joker's murder of two men who shared Dent's name as surnames, they discover that his next target will be Mayor Anthony Garcia (Nestor Carbonell), who will hosting Loeb's funeral in the morning. Disguised as the funeral's honor guards, the Joker and his men shoot against Garcia at the last minute, but Gordon foils it, apparently sacrificing himself in the prosses. When the Joker, who escapes through mass hysteria made by the funeral, names Rachel as the next victim, Batman plans to reveal his identity at a press conference that he has Dent hold, but Dent publicly names himself Batman to protect the truth. He is placed to protective custody and pursued by the Joker with a bazooka across the city, so Batman rushes to Dent's aid. Gordon, who has faked his death, helps apprehend the Joker and is promoted to Commissioner by Garcia.
              <br><br>

              Later that night Dent and Rachel disappear. Desperate to find them, Gordon has Batman interrogate the Joker, who tells them that both Dent and Rachel have been taken to two separate buildings rigged with two oil drum-activated time bombs on different sides of the city, and that Batman needs to choose just one to save. He immediately names their locations, and Batman goes to Rachel's while Gordon goes to Dent's, only to discover that the Joker has tricked them into going after the opposite person before both buildings explode, killing Rachel and scarring half of Dent's face. The Joker, on the other hand, detonates a third phone-activated bomb in the police station and escapes with Lau.
              <br><br>

              The next morning, Coleman Reese (Joshua Harto), an MNC law accountant at Wayne Enterprises who deduces Batman's true identity, plans to reveal it on TV. The Joker kills Lau and the Chechen, then threatens to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed, causing civil disorder and the evacuation of all local hospitals. Using direct action, Gordon and Bruce protect Reese, who changes his mind. Disguised as a nurse, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge through anarchic means. He then destroys the hospital and escapes with a bus-load of hostages. Dent, now going by a long-time nickname, "Two-Face", goes on a revengeful killing spree against the people responsible for Rachel's death, flipping his coin to determine their fates. First, he kills a cop who has helped kidnapped him, and then Maroni after interrogating the mob boss about the identity of Rachel's kidnapper. Meanwhile, in a state of emergency, Gordon calls for the National Guard as the Joker announces an game of chaos he's about to play on the city through reporter Mike Engel (Anthony Michael Hall), who is among the hostages taken from the destroyed hospital, and warns the people to flee if they don't want to be part of it, placing them into an emergency evacuation by ferries. To escalate the chaos, the Joker rigs two of the ferries with explosives; one ferry is full of citizens, the other of prison inmates and guards. He then gives the passengers of each ferry the choice to blow up the other, otherwise he will destroy both of them. The passengers ultimately refuse, however.
              <br><br>

              Batman asks a reluctant Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) to use a city-wide tracking prototype device to find the Joker; Fox agrees, but says he will resign immediately afterward. The Joker dresses up hostages as his men, luring Gordon's SWAT team to strike them, so Batman fights off both the SWAT team and the Joker's real men, rescuing the hostages. He then apprehends the Joker and disarms him of the detonator for both ferries, but the Joker gloats that he has won as Gotham will lose hope once Two-Face's rampage becomes public. The SWAT team arrives to take him into their custody. Two-Face lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died and holds Gordon's family hostage. Batman confronts Two-Face, who judges the fates of himself, Batman, and Gordon's son (Nathan Gamble) with three coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, then flips again to determine the boy's fate. Batman, who is wearing body armor, tackles Two-Face off the building, killing him and saving the boy.
              <br><br>

              He then convinces Gordon to frame him for the murders so that Harvey Dent will remain a symbol of hope for the city. Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal and launches a manhunt for the Batman, Alfred burns a letter written by Rachel to Bruce announcing her engagement to Dent, and Fox watches the signal tracker self-destruct.

      <a name="3"><h2>The Dark Knight Rises</h2>

          <p> Eight years after the events of the second film, the Dent Act, dedicated to Gotham City's late district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), grants the Gotham Police Department powers which nearly eradicate organized crime. Feeling guilty for covering up Dent's crimes, Police Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) writes a resignation speech confessing the truth but decides not to use it. Batman (Christian Bale) has disappeared and his alter ego, bilionaire socialite Bruce Wayne, has become a recluse. Cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) obtains Bruce's fingerprints from his home, kidnaps a congressman, then disappears to hand the fingerprints to Phillip Stryver (Burn Gorman), an assistant to Bruce's business rival John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn), in hope of having her criminal record erased so that she could commit crimes under the name "Catwoman". Stryver double-crosses Catwoman, but she uses the congressman's stolen phone to alert the police to their location. Gordon and the police arrive to find the congressman, and then pursue Stryver's men into the sewers while Catwoman flees. A masked militant called Bane (Tom Hardy) captures Gordon and steals his speech, but Gordon escapes and is found by John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a once-orphaned patrol officer who has deduced Batman's true identity from their similar backgrounds. Gordon promotes Blake to detective, with Blake reporting directly to him.
              <br><br>

              Wayne Enterprises is unprofitable after Bruce discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that the core could be weaponized. Later, Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange, using Bruce's fingerprints in a transaction that bankrupts Bruce. Concerned that Bruce has not moved on from being Batman, Bruce's family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) reveals to him that Bruce's childhood sweetheart, the late assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, had intended to marry Dent before she died. Alfred then resigns in an attempt to dissuade Bruce. Fearing that Daggett, Bane's employer, would gain access to the reactor, Bruce asks Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) to take over his company. After being promised the software to erase her criminal record, Catwoman agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's (Liam Neeson) mission to destroy Gotham with the League of Shadows remnant. He engages Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before taking him to a foreign, well-like prison where escape is virtually impossible. The inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, born in the prison and cared for by a fellow prisoner before escaping—the only prisoner to have ever done so. Bruce assumes the child to be Bane.
              <br><br>

              Meanwhile, Bane lures Gotham police underground and collapses the exits with them in it. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia (Nestor Carbonell) and forces a physicist he kidnapped from Uzbekistan six months prior, Dr. Leonid Pavel (Alon Abutbul), to convert the reactor core into a nuclear bomb. Bane uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating a revolution. The wealthy and powerful have their property expropriated and are dragged from their homes to be given show trials presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), where any sentence means likely death.
              <br><br>

              After months of recovery from his injury and re-training, Bruce escapes from the prison and enlists Selina, Blake, Tate, Gordon, and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) to help stop the bomb's detonation. While the police and Bane's forces clash, Batman defeats Bane, but Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself to be Talia al Ghul,[10] Ra's al Ghul's daughter. Talia escaped the prison aided by her fellow prisoner and protector, Bane. She plans to complete her father's work by detonating the bomb and destroying Gotham, but Gordon blocks her signal, preventing remote detonation. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Catwoman shoots Bane with the cannons on the Batpod. Batman pursues Talia with the Bat, an aircraft developed by Fox, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely destroys the reactor before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses the Bat to haul the bomb over the bay, where it detonates.
              <br><br>

              In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Bruce also presumed dead, Wayne Manor is left to the city to become an orphanage, and Wayne's remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed the Bat's autopilot six months prior, Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refurbished, Alfred witnesses Bruce and Selina together while visiting Florence, and Blake resigns from the police force and inherits the Batcave.
